President Faust, members of the Harvard Corporation and the Board of Overseers, members of the

00:11.000 --> 00:19.320
faculty, proud parents, and above all, graduates, the first thing I would like to say is thank

00:19.320 --> 00:26.679
you. Not only has Harvard given me an extraordinary honor, but the weeks of fear and nausea I

00:26.679 --> 00:34.759
have endured at the thought of giving this commencement address have made me lose weight.

00:34.759 --> 00:47.879
A win-win situation. Now all I have to do is take deep breaths, squint at the red banners,

00:47.879 --> 00:53.439
and convince myself that I am at the world's largest Gryffindor reunion.
